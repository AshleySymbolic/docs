In sample benchmarks, Leaf even out-performs frameworks like Slim PHP which was considered the most lightweight PHP micro-framework with blazing speed.

## Does Leaf scale?

Yes. Despite a common misconception that Leaf is only suitable for simple use cases, Leaf is perfectly capable of handling large scale applications:

- [Skeleton](https://skeleton.leafphp.dev) provides a base setup which holds your hand through separation of concerns. It provides a partial MVC setup which allows for incremental adoption.

  ::: warning Remember
  This is not a framework.
  :::

- [Leaf API](https://api.leafphp.dev) is an MVC framework bootstrapped with Leaf at it's core. It uses the [MVC architecture](https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mvc-architecture-3c827930b4c1) to ensure separation of concerns. Leaf API is specially crafted to aid rapid developement of powerful but scalable APIs.

- [Leaf MVC](https://mvc.leafphp.dev) just like Leaf API is a framework built with leaf that relies on the MVC architecture. The main difference is leaf MVC comes with tools which aid in building fullstack web apps/APIs. This makes Leaf MVC more general purpose, compared to the one-track API machine: Leaf API.

As you see above, all of these setups/frameworks are built using leaf as their core. Leaf can fit into any environment depending on how you use it.
