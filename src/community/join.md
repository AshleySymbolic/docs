# Join the Leaf PHP Community!

Leaf's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it. So... welcome!

Now we'll answer both what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.

## Resources

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](/coc) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

### Get Support

- [Forum](https://forum.leafphp.org/): The best place to ask questions and get answers about Leaf and its ecosystem.
- [Chat](https://chat.leafphp.org/): A place for Leaf devs to meet and chat in real time.
- [Meetups](https://events.leafphp.org/meetups): Want to find local Leaf PHP enthusiasts like yourself? Interested in becoming a community leader? We have the help and support you need right here!
- [GitHub](https://github.com/leafphp): If you have a bug to report or feature to request, that's what the GitHub issues are for. We also welcome pull requests!

### Explore the Ecosystem

- [The Awesome Leaf Page](https://github.com/leafphp/awesome-Leaf): See what other awesome resources have been published by other awesome people.

## What You Can Do

### Contribute Code

As with any project, there are rules to contributing. To ensure that we can help you or accept your pull request as quickly as possible, please read [the contributing guide](https://github.com/leafphp/Leaf/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

After that, you'll be ready to contribute to Leaf's core repositories:

- [Leaf](https://github.com/leafphp/Leaf): the core library
- [Leafx](https://github.com/leafphp/Leafx): Flux-inspired state management
- [Leaf-router](https://github.com/leafphp/Leaf-router): a routing system for SPAs

...as well as many smaller official [companion libraries](https://github.com/leafphp).

### Share (and Build) Your Experience

Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:

- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Leaf, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.
- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.

### Translate Docs

I hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?

See the [Translations guide](/v3.x/docs/contributing/translations.html) for more details on how you can get involved.

### Become a Community Leader

There's a lot you can do to help Leaf grow in your community:

- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Leaf developers continue to grow.
- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Leaf meetup in your area, you can start your own! Use the [resources at events.leafphp.org](https://events.leafphp.org/resources/#getting-started) to help you succeed!
- **Help meetup organizers.** There can never be too much help when it comes to running an event, so offer a hand to help out local organizers to help make every event a success.

If you have any questions on how you can get more involved with your local Leaf community, reach out at [@leafphp_Events](https://www.twitter.com/leafphp_events)!
