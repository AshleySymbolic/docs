# üçÅ Sugar Maple

![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/cli/v/stable)
![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/cli/downloads)

Leaf CLI v2 (Sugar Maple) builds on the functionality provided by the earlier version. It comes with faster load times, full scaffolds, bug fixes and a ton of other powerful functionality. You can now work with presets, scaffold projects using both v2 and v3 of leaf.

Unlike v1, v2 supports all leaf scaffolds: leaf, leaf mvc, leaf api and skeleton. It also uses in-built scaffolds instead of zip files packaged on leaf downloads coupled with composer downloads which make Leaf CLI 2 faster and even more reliable.

## Creating a leaf app

To start a new project, simply open up your console or terminal and move into the directory you want to generate your project. From there, you can use the `create` command:

```bash
leaf create <project-name>
```

This will now prompt you to select a preset <Badge text="New in v2" />

```sh
Creating a new Leaf app "<project-name>" in ./projects-directory.

Please pick a preset 
  [0] leaf
  [1] leaf mvc
  [2] leaf api
  [3] skeleton
 > 
```

::: tip
Note that you are to select a number, not type the name of the preset.
:::

Selecting a number will generate a leaf app based on the associated preset. As you can see, there are 4 presets:

- **Leaf**: a bare leaf project (supports leaf 3)
- **Leaf MVC**: a leaf MVC project with leaf 2
- **Leaf API**: a leaf API project with leaf 2
- **Skeleton**: a leaf skeleton project (supports leaf 3)

After picking a preset, your project will be automatically generated and initialized. All you need to do is open it up and start coding üöÄ

### Quick presets

Leaf CLI also provides a quicker way to initialize your project without having to go through the interactive installer. You can use the `--mvc`, `--api`, `--basic` and `--skeleton` options to generate your project based on a specific presets. `--basic` generates a raw leaf project.

eg: `leaf create backend-api --api`

This will create a leaf api project named `backend-api`.

### Versioning

You might have noticed earlier that some presets had `(supports leaf 3)` attached to them. These presets come in both leaf 2 and leaf 3 versions. Although leaf 3 beta has not yet been released, we are working on allowing leaf's presets to use Leaf 3's dev version for all those curious about it.

By default, leaf cli will create a leaf 2 setup for your project, however, for presets which support Leaf 3, adding a `--v3` flag will switch to the v3 build instead of using Leaf v2.

eg: `leaf create backend-api --v3` or `leaf create backend-api --skeleton --v3`.

## Running your leaf apps

After generating your leaf app, you can `cd` into the directory and spin up a local dev server using leaf cli's `serve` command.

```sh
cd backend-api
leaf serve
```

You can also specify the port to run your leaf app on using the `--port` or `-p` options.

```sh
leaf serve -p 3000
```

## Installing packages

This cli tool also adds a feature to install leaf packages from composer

```bash
leaf install ui
```

## Interactive Shell

You can also use the interactive shell to interact with your app.

```bash
$ leaf app:interact
...
>>> $user = new User;
...
>>> $user->name = "Mychi";
...
>>> $user->save();
```

## Updating leaf cli

v2 contains an easy way to quickly update leaf cli to the latest version.

```bash
leaf update
```
