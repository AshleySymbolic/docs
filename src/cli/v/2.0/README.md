## ðŸ“• Usage Guide

### ðŸš§ Creating projects

To start a new project, simply open up your console or terminal in your directory
for projects and enter:

```bash
leaf create <project-name>
```

This will generate a new Leaf PHP app in the `<project-name>` directory. You can also create [Leaf API](leaf-api/) and [Leaf MVC](https://github.com/leafsphp/leafmvc) apps from the cli.

**Leaf API:**

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --api
```

or

```bash
leaf create <project-name> -a
```

**Leaf MVC:**

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --mvc
```

or

```bash
leaf create <project-name> -m
```

### âž• Installing packages

This cli tool also adds a feature to install packages from composer

```bash
leaf install leafs/ui
```

### ðŸ§¿ Interactive Shell

You can also use the interactive shell to interact with your app.

```bash
$ leaf app:interact
...
>>> $user = new User;
...
>>> $user->name = "Mychi";
...
>>> $user->save();
```

### ðŸ“º Previewing your app

This opens up your app on the PHP local server.

```bash
leaf app:serve
```

You can also specify the port

```bash
leaf app:serve -p 8000
```
