# Sponsor Leaf PHP Development

Leaf PHP is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use.
However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support Leaf PHP development via the following methods:

## One-time Donations

We accept donations through these channels:

<support-Coins />

## Recurring Pledges

Recurring pledges come with exclusive perks, e.g. having your name listed in the Leaf GitHub repository, or have your company logo placed on this website.

- [Become a backer or sponsor via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou) (goes directly to support Darko's full-time work on Leaf)

If you run a business and are using Leaf in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Leaf development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.** It can also help your exposure in the Leaf community and makes it easier to attract Leaf developers.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Leaf, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while.
